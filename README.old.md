# How to test the software

How to test the software: describe the steps needed for a developer to get a test
development environment working, such as running the website on their local
machine (you could alternatively make a test server that everyone can use). Be
sure to include information on setting up any databases or other necessary
services. (이거아닌것 같긴한데 대충 만듬)

We make a test.page for testing new component.

You can test your own component on http://localhost:3000/test.

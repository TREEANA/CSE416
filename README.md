# Problem Statement
Target User: general consumers who want to purchase wine for a specific purpose but lack knowledge of wine.

Problem: Since the target users do not know well about wine, they need experts' help to choose wine for their desired purpose. However, getting help from sommeliers is difficult and expensive, so access to wine could be tricky.

Solution: Create a wine guide website that offers general users wine ratings and experts'(sommeliers') pairings. With those, target users can find a wine that suits their taste and purpose without background knowledge of wine.

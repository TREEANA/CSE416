# Problem Statement
Client base: General consumers or restaurants that want to have a carefully selected wine list

Problem: It is difficult for the above client base to know which wine is a good wine or how to purchase it at a lower price. This is because they have so much to learn to build knowledge of wine, and hiring sommeliers is quite expensive, so they have poor access to wine

Solution: If sommeliers share their knowledge with the general consumers or restaurant to increase access to wine, wouldn't this increase the popularity of wine and have a good effect on the themselves. We will create a website that helps sommeliers easily share their recommended wine lists and their knowledge to the public and allows general consumers or restaurants to purchase wine at low prices.
